# downloads-folder-automation

Automating the process of sorting files in a user's folder on Windows by file type.

This script iterates through the files in the folder and moves them to their respective sub-folders. If the
sub-folder does not exist, it is created then the files moved into it.

## Prerequisites

This script requires Python to be installed for it to run. To install Python, click [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Usage

$ cd downloads-folder-automation
```

To run the script:

```
$ python downloads_folder_sorter.py
```
